# Penguins web app deployed on Heroku

Check out the YouTube video showing the development of this web app at https://youtu.be/zK4Ch6e1zq8

The deployed web app is live at https://dp-penguins.herokuapp.com/

This web app predicts the species of penguins as a function of their input parameters (bill length, bill width, flipper length, body mass, sex and island).

The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:
* streamlit
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* pickle
